 Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

 1. Install Python
Make sure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

 2. Create a Virtual Environment
To create a virtual environment on your Windows system, use the following command:

bash
py -m venv env


 3. Activate the Virtual Environment
To activate the virtual environment, run:

bash
env\Scripts\activate.bat


 4. Install Required Packages
To install Django Rest Framework (DRF), JWT authentication, and Redis, execute the following commands:

- To install Django and Django Rest Framework:
  bash
  pip install django djangorestframework
  

- To install JWT Authentication:
  bash
  pip install djangorestframework-simplejwt
  

- To install Redis:

 Introduction to the Project

The Inventory Management System is designed to manage inventory items efficiently with features for user authentication, CRUD operations, and caching to improve performance.

 Models
I created a model called Inventory where I added fields related to the inventory item.

 Serializer File
The serializer file validates the data coming from the endpoints and handles the saving and sending of data.

 Views
Different views were created for functionalities such as login, logout, and CRUD operations for managing the inventory.

 Unit Testing
Separate files were created for unit tests related to different components like views, models, and serializers.

 Features
- **JWT Authentication:** The application uses JWT for secure user authentication.
- **Logging:** Integrated logging to track records of all errors and executions.
- **Redis:** Utilized Redis for faster data retrieval and execution.
